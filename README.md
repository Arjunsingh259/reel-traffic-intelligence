Samsung EnnovateX 2025 AI Challenge Submission
Problem Statement: Real-time detection of reel/video traffic versus non-reel/video traffic in a social networking application, enabling user equipment (UE) to optimize performance dynamically. The model should also ensure accuracy under varying network congestion and coverage conditions.

Attribution
This project is built on top of various open-source libraries such as Scikit-learn, FastAPI, and NumPy. We have used these libraries for data processing, model training, and real-time deployment. Our original contributions include:

The development of a hybrid CNN + BiLSTM model architecture specifically designed to be robust against changes in network conditions.

The creation of a synthetic data generator to simulate real-world network conditions, including congestion and varying coverage.

The implementation of a complete, end-to-end system with REST and WebSocket API endpoints using FastAPI for real-time deployment.

Summary
Reel Traffic Intelligence is an AI-powered system designed to detect and classify reel (short video) versus non-reel traffic in real time. It works by analyzing network and application-level features, enabling user equipment (UE) to optimize bandwidth usage and provide a better user experience.

Developed for the Samsung EnnovateX AI Challenge 2025, this project represents a unique step toward smarter social networking ecosystems that adapt seamlessly to user behavior while maintaining efficiency, fairness, and scalability
